// In your Homework repo, create a new directory named "Week2" and then within that directory, create a JavaScript file - name it something that indicates it is homework for Week 2
// Inside your JS file, create two variables: pizzaPlace and numberOfToppings
const pizzaPlace = "Stacee Serves Pizza";
let numberOfToppings = 5;

console.log(pizzaPlace, typeof pizzaPlace); // string
console.log(numberOfToppings, typeof numberOfToppings); // number

console.log(`At ${pizzaPlace} we offer ${numberOfToppings}; Pizza Toppings.`);

if (numberOfToppings <= 10) {
  console.log("Quality, not quantity.");
}

// Have the variables reference the name of your Pizza Place and the number of toppings your Pizza Place offers.


// Print the variables and their types.


// Print a template literal that uses both variables to construct a short sentence about your Pizza Place.


// Construct an if statement that prints "Quality, not quantity." if you offer less than 10 toppings, or "A whole lot of pizza." if you offer 10 or more toppings.
